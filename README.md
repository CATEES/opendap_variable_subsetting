### For Developers

You must have the `conda` tool available on your path, either from an [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) installation.

Run `./develop.sh` to create a development environment and launch Jupyter in your browser (ctrl-c to end the Jupyter session).

You may want to clean notebooks with _Cell_ > _All Output_ > _Clear_ before committing updates.
